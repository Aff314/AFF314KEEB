# Bulid guide 🚧 WIP 🚧

If you want to build the board feel free to do that, but you should probably wait until I've actually tested if every thing works. Then there should also be a buildguide available. 

## Building the board

🚧 Wip 🚧

Is going to be posted once the parts arrive.
But you basically just have to solder everything on.

## Flashing the firmware
First you have to download the [uf2 file](Firmware/AFF314KEEB-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2) or you could build the firmware on your own if for example you wanted to change the keymap or anything else.

In the next step you have to put your MCU in bootloder mode by connecting it to your pc and double pressing the reset-button.
Once it shows up as a drive
